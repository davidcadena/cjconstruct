      <h1>Construct Booth - Making a Video Game</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h1>How do I start?</h1>
      <p>Today we are going to use "Construct Classic" to make our video game, you can download it
        <a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/construct/files/construct/Classic/ConstructClassic_r1-2.exe/download">here</a>.
        Construct Classic is a cool tool that lets you make a wide variety of video games.
      </p>
      <h1>Installing Construct Classic</h1>
      <p>After downloading the file, run the installer. If you need any help during installation let one of the mentors know.</p>
      <h1>Making a new Project</h1>
      <p>Now that Construct is installed lets make a game. Start-up Construct on your computer. First click on <em>"File"</em> in the top left corner of the program, then click <em>"New"</em> and click into <em>"New Direct-X game"</em> ,or you can hit <span class="green">CTRL + N</span> on your keyboard. This creates a new blank game for us to build upon, but lets talk about video game mechanics.</p>

      <h1>Video Game Mechanics</h1>
      <p>We are going to be making a '2-dimensional' Video game. These games have a few components we need to be aware of;</p>
      <ul id="container_ul">
        <li>- <span class="blue bold">A Background</span></li>
        <li>- <span class="green bold">A Player</span></li>
        <li>- <span class="red bold">Some Enemies</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Sprites</h1>
      <p>So before we can make the game, we need at least these three things; a <span class="blue">Background</span>, a <span class="green">Player</span>, and some <span class="red">Enemies</span>. These objects are called <em>"Sprites"</em> ,they can be made with any drawing program, like paint. We are going to be making our <em>"Sprites"</em> in the Construct program, but you can draw your's in paint too.</p>
      <h1>The Background</h1>
      <p>Lets start with the background, this is the level that is underneath a players' feet. The player and the enemies move over it, it needs to have a simple style, if the style of the background is too complicated then the player will feel distracted (and may even get sick!). First right-click into the white space in the middle of the screen, then select <em>"Insert an object"</em>.</p>
      <img class="img" src="images/rightClickInsertObjectInMainWindow.png" />
      <p>A new window will pop up called <em>"Construct : Insert new object"</em>. This window contains everything you can insert into a project, don't worry we are not going to cover all this junk today. We just want to insert a background for now, within this window find <em>"Tiled Background"</em> then click <em>"Insert"</em> at the top-right of the window.</p>
      <img class="img" src="images/objectWindowInsertTiledBackground.png" />
      <p>The window will close, and you will be back to the main window. Your cursor will change to a big plus mark <em>"+"</em> click anywhere in the white space to insert the background.</p>
      <img class="img" src="images/pictureEditorNew.png" />
      <p>This new window is the sprite editor, here is where we are going to make our tiled background. You can begin drawing with the tools at the left, I am using the brush tool. Remember - don't choose colors that are too crazy, or you might get sick! I recommend choosing a light blue.</p>
      <img class="img" src="images/pictureEditorTBTools.png" />
      <p>The reason we don't color a solid block of color is because this is a <em>Tiled</em> Background, if it was all one color then the player would not be able to tell where they were going, so put a lining around the block near the edges.</p>
      <img class="img" src="images/pictureEditorTBSave.png" />
      <p>When your sprite is done, hit <em>"Save"</em> at the top left corner. Save this file somewhere on your computer, I recommend saving it to the Desktop folder.</p>
      <img class="img" src="images/dragTB.png" />
      <p>Now that it is saved somewhere safe, close out of the editing window <em>(If it asks you to save again, hit "OK")</em>. You should see one tile in the middle of the screen, make the tile fill the screen by dragging the squares in the corners of the tile.</p>
      <img class="img" src="images/backgroundFinal.png" />
      <p>Your background should look something like this, we are almost done adding it, and are almost ready to start adding a player and enemies. <em>(Ask a mentor if you need any help)</em> -----------------------</p>
